                    <p>
                        An interactive web application to provide
                        participants with information about a chess
                        tournament and the ability ot sign up. 
                        <br><br>
                        The front end was made with Bootstrap and EJS
                        and the backend was made with Node and Express
                        with the database of schools held in MongoDB Atlas.
                        <br><br>
                        For this project, I acted as lead developer and project
                        manager, as I brought together a group of developers to 
                        design and implement the website over 2 months. We worked
                        with a strict deadline and budget.

                        A demo mobile application that receives audio files of
                        phone calls, transcribes them, and uses a custom AI model
                        to determine the likelihood of the call being a scam.
                        <br><br>
                        The app was made with a flutter front-end, and a google firebase
                        database. The AI model was developed with TensorFlow.
                        <br><br>
                        This project was developed in 36 hours for the Queen's University
                        Hackathon, QHacks. I was in charge of front-end design and routing
                        audio files from the user's phone to the app to the database, as seen 
                        in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsHFJWEPO2M">this demo.</a>
